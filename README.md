# Mobile Flashcards

Mobile Flashcards is a React Native app for iOS and Android that allows users to create decks, add cards and quiz themselves.

It uses React Native, Expo, Redux, & React Navigation.

This app is the third of three projects required for [Udacity's React Nanodegree program](https://www.udacity.com/course/react-nanodegree--nd019).

```

## Usage

The project can be run with npm, yarn or expo
